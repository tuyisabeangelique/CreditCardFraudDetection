<h1>Credit Card Fraud Detection</h1>

This project demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of machine learning models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Python, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle.

**Project Overview**

Credit card fraud detection is a critical task in ensuring secure and trustworthy financial transactions. In this project, we utilized machine learning models to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent. The project includes:

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Training and evaluation of classification models.
- Visualization of results using confusion matrices and ROC curves.

**Dataset:**

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle: [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
